# Security

As an industry association and standards development organization (SDO), the PDF Association considers all PDF security matters as important and strongly encourages [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/SpecialReport/2017_003_001_503340.pdf).

However correct, secure, and robust implementation of PDF software is a matter for each software implementor. Any discovered security vulnerabilities should be responsibly reported directly to the vendor or implementor on a case-by-case basis.
